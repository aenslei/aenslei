# About Me 📝💻
Hi! I'm Ainsley Cabading, a Cybersecurity student in Singapore and aiming to study for a specialised degree in this field in the Singapore Institute of Technology.
My interests mainly lie in penetration testing, digital forensics, malware reverse engineering and (most recently) cybersecurity hardware, like the Flipper Zero, with custom payload scripting.

# Tech! 💻

I've always wanted to learn custom payload scripting with BadUSBs. Now that I have my FZ, I've been learning Powershell, duckyScript and soon Zshell for MacOS.
