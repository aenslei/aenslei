# About Me üìùüíª
Hi! I'm Ainsley Cabading, a Cybersecurity student in Singapore and aiming to study for a specialised degree in this field in the Singapore Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>
My interests mainly lie in penetration testing, digital forensics, malware reverse engineering and (most recently) cybersecurity hardware, like the Flipper Zero, with custom payload scripting.

# Current Projects </>
_‚úß‚Çä‚Å∫ winspect Tool: PowerShell-Based Security Inspector for Windows_ <br/>
Developing a tool in pure PowerShell to check a device's security posture to determine its access to a company's intranet. <br/><br/>
This project is being developed during my GovTech Singapore Girls-in-Tech Mentorship Programme! Thank you to my mentor in GovTech's Cybersecurity Group for her advice, guidance and extensive work experience. Ÿ©(ÔΩ°Õ°‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢ÔΩ°)€∂ <br/><br/>
I'll work to enhance Winspect's current functionalities and add more user-based functions like report creation. <br/><br/>

_‚úß‚Çä‚Å∫ USB Payload Scripting_ <br/><br/>
I've always wanted to learn custom payload scripting with BadUSBs. Now that I have my FZ, I've been learning Powershell, duckyScript and soon Zshell for MacOS.
