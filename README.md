<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Ainsley. Welcome to my coding swamp ( ˘▽˘)っ</h1>

# About Me 📝💻
Hi! I'm Ainsley Cabading, a Cybersecurity student in Singapore and aiming to study for a specialised degree in this field in the Singapore Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>
My interests mainly lie in penetration testing, digital forensics, malware reverse engineering and (most recently) cybersecurity hardware, like the Flipper Zero, with custom payload scripting.

# Tech! 💻

# Current Projects </>
_✧₊⁺ **SENTRI**: Securing Entry to Network Through Regulation and Inspection_ <br/>
Developing a tool in pure PowerShell to check a device's security posture to determine its access to a company's intranet. <br/><br/>
This project is being developed during my GovTech Singapore Girls-in-Tech Mentorship Programme! Thank you to my mentor in GovTech's Cybersecurity Group for her advice, guidance and extensive work experience. ٩(｡͡•‿•｡)۶ <br/><br/>
Still a Work-in-Progress! I'll update the project as I think of new ideas to implement. <br/>

_✧₊⁺ **USB Payload Scripting**_ <br/>
I've always wanted to learn custom payload scripting with BadUSBs. Now that I have my FZ, I've been learning Powershell, duckyScript and soon Zshell for MacOS.<br/>
I come back to this project from time to time whenever I'm free to make new payloads!
